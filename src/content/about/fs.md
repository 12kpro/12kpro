_My adventure in the world of information technology began when I was a child with the best gift ever: a COMMODORE 64. In my eyes at that time it was just a magic box, but that was enough to light the spark!_

I had to wait until the first jobs and savings before I could afford a PC to keep me busy with, which then accompanied me on a professional path where I pushed myself into increasingly complex and automated technologies.
Thanks to these experiences, I immersed myself in this world and understood many things, including the usefulness of an old CPU in making an excellent coffee at 4 in the morning.

Some people I met were important as well. They recognized my skills, encouraged me to pursue a path in the world of web development, taught me that patience, listening, discussion and commitment are an opportunity to grow as a person and as a professional.
Just two more bits about me: I'm an passionate hiker, snowboarder and nature lover. I was a volleyball agonist for several years, where I learned to work as a team and to accept a defeat.

> All this has led me to where I am today, but I won't stop and in fact I can't wait to find out who I will be tomorrow!
