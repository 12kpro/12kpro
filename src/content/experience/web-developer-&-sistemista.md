This was a chaotic and exciting period, I got to know many realities and their needs. An opportunity to find and invent solutions in often frenetic and disorganized situations with different specificities and requests, often outside the strict rules of the theory.
Creativity and flexibility were dominant, but the experience, the knowledge and the fact of having worked on projects and with different work groups represents an undeniable value.
