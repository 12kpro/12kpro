The first job with responsibilities: in this period I had to deal with the challenge of organizing and managing production. I learned what an industrialization process is, bills of materials, workflows, staff organization, regulations and teamwork.
Although we were an inexperienced group, we grew and in just a few years the company's turnover doubled.
